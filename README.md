# Keylogger Program

## Overview
This is a simple keylogger program written in Python using the `pynput` library. It captures and logs all keystrokes and saves them to a file named `keylog.txt`. The program stops logging when the `Esc` key is pressed.

## Features
- Logs alphanumeric keys and special keys.
- Saves logged keys to `keylog.txt`.
- Gracefully stops when the `Esc` key is pressed.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the `pynput` library:
   ```sh
   pip install pynput
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Program**:
   Navigate to the directory containing the script and run it:
   ```sh
   python keylogger.py
   ```

2. **Stop the Program**:
   Press the `Esc` key to stop the keylogger gracefully.

## Ethical Considerations
This keylogger program is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers to capture keystrokes without consent is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have explicit permission to use this software and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
